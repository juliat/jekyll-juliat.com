<p class="description">
The ChemCollective is a group which provides free online resources for chemistry teachers and students. As part of my summer internship there, I redesigned the ChemCollective logo. The new logo is meant to better communicate the identity of the ChemCollective in terms of both personality and purpose. The new colors and type better reflect the friendly and vibrant personality of the ChemCollective. By incorporating a graduated cylinder (in the wordmark) and the equilibrium symbol, the new logo better communicates the purpose of the ChemCollective-- to provide resources for teaching and learning chemistry. </p>
