<p class="description">
I created the logo for the <a href="http://www.scottylabs.org">ScottyLabs</a> event, SkillSwap. SkillSwap is a two-day event where students who are experts in a topic lead workshops about that topic. SkillSwap 2012 had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/453892161321541/">over 400 attendees</a>.
</p>
<p class="description">
	The logo had to be consistent with other ScottyLabs branding, as well as communicate that SkillSwap would be a casual, fun event. I designed the SkillSwap website to be mobile friendly so that people at the event could easily access information about the schedule and workshops throughout the weekend.
