<p class="description">
TartanHacks is a new hackathon organized by the student group
ScottyLabs. As the lead designer on the student team organizing the event, I created posters to advertise
TartanHacks. The posters were intended to appeal to people who had not previously participated in
hackathons. They also communicate the eventâ€™s focus on ideas and learning. </p>
