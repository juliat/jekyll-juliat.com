<p class="description">
Working in a team with two other students in Human-Computer Interaction, I designed and prototyped a web application which allows researchers to make their research more accessible to the general public.</p>

<p class="description">
Our process had five stages: needfinding, ideation, storyboarding and speed dating, pitch, and prototype. Essentially, we started by trying to understand the problem we were trying to solve, then generated ideas, then showed some prototypes of our best ideas to other people to see what they thought, then picked an idea and promoted it, and finally built a high-fidelity prototype for it.
