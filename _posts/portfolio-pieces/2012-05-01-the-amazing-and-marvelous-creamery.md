<p class="description">
As a project for my course Application Design and Development, I developed a management system for a fictional chain of ice cream stores: the Amazing and Marvelous Creamery. 
</p>
<p class="description">
I designed the database and wrote the back-end code in Ruby on Rails. I also designed the UX for the front end, including dashboards for each type of user: Administrator, Manager, and Employee.
