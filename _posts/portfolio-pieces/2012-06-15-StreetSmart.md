<p class="description">
StreetSmart is an mobile app that uses crime data to show you what streets nearby are safe to walk on. I pitched the idea for the app to my teammates because I had recently moved to New York City and worried about which places were safe to walk. 
</p>
<p class="description">
The app geolocates users or asks them for their location, then displays a map of nearby streets, which are color coded for their safety based on crime data from <a href="http://www.spotcrime.com">SpotCrime</a>.
</p>

At the <a href="http://hacknjill.com/">Hack'n Jill Hackathon</a> in June 2012, I worked with four other designers and developers to design and prototype the app StreetSmart in a day.
