<p class="description">
I created the logo and website for <a href="http://www.scottylabs.org">ScottyLabs</a>, a technical resource group for students that promotes innovation in practical ways. The site has two intended audiences: students interested in participating in ScottyLabs or attending our events, and potential partners or sponsors. </p>

<p class="description">
The site's design is meant to communicate that ScottyLabs is inspiring, technical, innovative, fresh, and rebellious. The design shown here is the result of four design iterations.
