<p class="description">
TartanHacks is a new hackathon
organized by the student group
ScottyLabs. As the lead designer on the student team organizing the event, I created the logo
for the hackathon. The logo for TartanHacks extends the ScottyLabs logo (which I also designed) in order to link the
organization and the event. </p>
