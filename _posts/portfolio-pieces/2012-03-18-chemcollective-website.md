<p class="description">
I created new information
architecture and visual style for the
ChemCollective homepage. The
new homepage is more inviting to
first time visitors to the site, and
allows experienced users to quickly
access resources. I implemented the
design using HTML and CSS.</p>

<p class="description">
On the old ChemCollective website,
all the available activities were listed
on one static page. The new site
uses clickable expanding lists to
allow users to quickly find activities
for a given chemistry topic.</p>
