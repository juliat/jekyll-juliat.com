About this directory: _layouts

For this boilerplate, you can pretty much ignore this directory, since all the layouts and styling
info is in the theme you use/create. The only reason you'd start caring about this directory was
if you changed the name of the folder/the theme that you want to use for the layout. In that case,
you'd want to open up the pages in this theme and edit the includes statements that look like this:

{% include themes/mine/bottom.html %}
